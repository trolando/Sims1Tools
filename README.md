# Sims 1 Tools

These tools were created by me (Tom van Dijk) in 2000-2002. Eventually I lost interest when I went to study at University and unfortunately I never really came back to continue the work.
I've lost most of the source code of these tools. I have some old backup of the source code of 26 October 2002, and I have the executables for most of the tools.

I recompiled XAbatch and I found an old FARx executable in my archives. The other executables I recovered from [beyondsims](https://beyondsims.com/games/sims-1/downloads/).

## Tools

- [FARx](../../raw/master/FARx.zip)  
  The main tool for editing FAR files, which are basically container files containing other files such as XA files and IFF files.
- [IFF Pencil 2](../../raw/master/IFF%20Pencil%202.zip)  
  The main tool for editing IFF files, can do most of what the other tools can do.
- [Constant Contraption](../../raw/master/Constant%20Contraption.zip)  
  Editor for the "behavior constants" (BCON resources) of objects in IFF files.
- [Strings Scavenger](../../raw/master/Strings%20Scavenger.zip)  
  Editor for the "behavior strings" (STR# resources) of objects in IFF files.
- [Animation Alchemist](../../raw/master/Animation%20Alchemist.zip)  
  Editor to change the animation names used by objects in IFF files.
- [Xantippe](../../raw/master/Xantippe.zip)  
  Converts XA files to WAV files.
- [Career Creator 3](../../raw/master/Career%20Creator%203.zip)  
  Specialised editor for the careers in The Sims 1.
- [TransPatcher 2](../../raw/master/TransPatcher%202.zip)  
  Simple tool to fix odd colors in later expansion packs, due to the palettes in SPR2 resources.
- [XAbatch](../../raw/master/XAbatch.zip)  
  Mass converts XA files to WAV files, even inside FAR files (parameter `-f`) and in subdirectories (`-s`). This is a command-line application. Copy the executable to the root of your The Sims 1 installation before running it.
